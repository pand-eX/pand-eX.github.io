user_description: It all started when I was working with quantum trading in the stock market and the data I was needing coming all misconfigured and wrong. So I decide to take a course to get this data straight to my source of financial analysis. When he started studying I found a totally amazing world with high possibilities and fell in love with these processes to extract and take to his destination properly. And why did I decide to abandon quantum analysis? Instead of worrying about variables and semicolons that worried me about data models and pipelines, this allows me to think about problems differently rather than getting stuck in the code, I can think more realistically about different approaches and methods and try to understand which is best suited for the solution I'm building.
