user_description: It all started when i was working with quant trade and the data i need was coming all misconfigured and errored. So you decide to take a course to get this data right to my source of financial analysis. When I started studying I found a totally amazing world with high possibilities and fell in love with building these processes to extract and take to their destination correctly. And why did I decide to abandon the quant analysis? Instead of worrying about variables and semicolons I care about models and data pipelines, this allows me to think about problems differently rather than getting stuck in the code, I can think more realistically about different approaches and methods and try to understand which is best suited for the solution I'm building.
