user_description: It all started when I was working with quantum trading in the stock market and the data I needed came all misconfigured and wrong. Therefore, I decide to take a course to get this data directly to my source of financial analysis. When I started studying I discovered a totally amazing world with great possibilities and fell in love with these processes to extract and take to their destination properly. And why did I decide to abandon quantum analysis? Instead of worrying about variables and semicolons I worry about data models and pipelines. this allows me to think about problems differently rather than getting stuck in the code, I can think more realistically about different approaches and methods and try to understand which one is best suited for the solution I'm building.
